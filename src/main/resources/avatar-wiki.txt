Development
In 2006, Cameron stated that if Avatar was successful, he hoped to make two sequels to the film.[4] In 2010, he said the film's widespread success confirmed that he would do so.[5] The sequels were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015.[6] He included certain scenes in the first film for future story follow-ups.[4][13] Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work "once the novel is nailed down".[47] He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons of Polyphemus.[48] The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the rainforest.[49] He intended to capture footage for the sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a deepwater submersible.[50] In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental theme of the first film, would not be "strident" since the film will concentrate on entertainment.[51] The sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009.[14] Cameron implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story.[52] In 2011, Cameron stated his intention to film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, in order to add a heightened sense of reality.[53]

In 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).[54][55]

Cameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time in 2012; and was officially confirmed the following year.[56][57] Cameron was then looking to release Avatar 2 in 2015, but later that year, production was rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels in 2017 and 2018.[58] By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year, with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which Cameron called "a complex job".[59][60] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.[61] In February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand.[62] In April 2016, Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four Avatar sequels, all of which will be filmed simultaneously.[63] The four Avatar sequels share a $1 billion budget (e.g. $250 million each film).[64]

New crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on True Lies and Titanic, and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels.[65][66][67] Kirk Krack, founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the underwater scenes.[68] Several creatures introduced in the theme park attraction Avatar Flight of Passage will be featured in the film.[69]

Writing
In 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as "separate stories that have an overall arc inclusive of the first film", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the second, and Shane Salerno for the third.[58] However, Friedman later clarified and stated that Jaffa and Silver were writing the first of the four sequels and he was writing the second.[70] In April 2014, Cameron expected to finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases.[71][72] He stated that although Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together on all three scripts: "I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie."[58][73][74][37][70][75] Cameron added that they had "worked out every beat of the story across all three films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga", a creative process that was inspired by his experiences in the writing room of his television series Dark Angel.[76] The writing took longer than expected, forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015.[59]

He spent a whole year writing and completing a full script for the first sequel titled Avatar: The High Ground, a 130-page treatment and then threw it out and started all over again because "it didn’t go enough into the unexpected,” which is one of those critical elements about sequels, according to Cameron. At one point he threatened to fire his writers because they would only focus on the new stories rather than first figuring out what made the original movie a success.[77][78] In December 2015, Cameron stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, saying "I'm in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts [...] Just refining. That's in parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set]."[79] On February 11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete.[80] In a November 26 interview the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall.[81]

Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron stated that "It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these".[81] He later compared the sequels to The Godfather franchise, calling it "a generational family saga [...] It's a continuation of the same characters and about what happens when warriors, willing to go on suicide charges and leap off cliffs on to the backs of big orange Toruks, grow up and have their own kids. Now the kids are the change makers. It's interesting."[82]

Discussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old, and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: "There's a three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in. Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on Avatar, I now knew how to write the Jake character going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies."[29][83] In a December 2019 interview, Lang stated that his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him "that Quaritch had a future" while shooting the original film.[84]

Sigourney Weaver has stated that "The story is about family, about our families trying to stay together [and] the lengths to which we all go to protect each other and protect the place where we live. It’s very much based on [James Cameron's] family and his joy in the family; and also, how vulnerable you are when you have children."[85] Cameron has stated that the film addresses the implications of Jake and Neytiri becoming parents in the time that elapsed since the first film.[86] Cameron stated:
Becoming a parent changes so much of your behavior and your value system...What we saw in the first film were people who were fearless. Jake would throw himself off his ikran onto a leonopteryx (creatures featured in Avatar) but is a father of four going do that?...He's trying to keep his kids alive and trying to adjust his own life. Is he still a warrior? Are these young boys who are 14, 15, 16, coming up, getting all excited about wanting to go to war and fight for their people and for their land? How's [Jake] going to be a hypocrite and hold them back when he has to go do it?[86]

Casting
Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the sequels.[13] Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite the demise of their characters.[37][16] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels (the fourth one was not planned at the time), and that her character, Grace Augustine, would be alive.[17] In March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.[3] Cameron confirmed in 2010 that Lang would return as Quaritch in the first three sequels, stating, "I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga."[37][38] In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez stated that unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in Avatar 2.[87]

Several new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all confirmed to return from the first film.[30][31][26][34] Additionally, Cliff Curtis joined the cast as Tonowari, the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina.[24][26] On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role.[88] On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as the children of Jake and Neytiri, Geljo, Bailey Bass, and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis), and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora.[27][28] Cameron later stated that the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath "in the two- to four-minute range", even then-seven-year-old Trinity Bliss, and were now "all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while holding their breath".[89][90]

On October 3, 2017, it was reported that Kate Winslet, who starred in Cameron's Titanic (1997), had joined the cast of Avatar 2, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented, "Kate and I had been looking for something to do together for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career", and added that her character was named Ronal.[19][91][20] Although the nature of her character was originally unknown, Cameron stated the following month that Ronal was "part of the Sea People, the reef people", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making Avatar 2 Winslet's first role via performance capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; as she insisted on performing all her character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free-diving for the film.[81][21] Winslet, who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he puts his actors in for their scenes, stated that Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to help her and their fellow Titanic collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the scripts shortly after.[21] She commented that her role was "relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot", as she would only have one month of shootings, but also "a pivotal character in the ongoing story".[21]

On October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the first film, in all four upcoming Avatar films.[43] On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as Dr. Max Patel.[35] A year later, Edie Falco, Brendan Cowell, and Michelle Yeoh joined the cast in live-action roles.[44][45][92] However, in October 2022, it was announced that Yeoh was only in subsequent sequels and not The Way of Water, as previously reported.[93] In early April 2019, Vin Diesel announced that he would be joining the cast of the Avatar sequel, although it was not clearly specified which sequels he would be in.[94][95] In October 2019, Edward Norton revealed that he had turned down a role in Avatar 2, due to only being interested in playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not.[96]

Filming
Performance capture
Avatar: The Way of Water had entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan Beach, California, as the main shooting location.[97] Principal photography started on September 25, 2017, simultaneously with Avatar 3.[38][98][99] As Sigourney Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of Doc Martin.[100]

On November 23, Cameron stated that the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14, featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.[81] He stated "we're getting really good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the code".[89][90] He said that tests would last until January 2018, as "we're still working in our small test tank. We graduate to our big tank in January".[89] It was "a dialogue scene", as according to Cameron, the characters communicate via "a kind of a sign language".[81]

On April 30, 2018, Kate Winslet had "just a couple days" of shooting left to do.[101] While filming an underwater scene, Winslet held her breath for over seven minutes, breaking the record for longest breath held while shooting a film scene underwater, a record previously held by Tom Cruise for Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.[18] In May 2018, Saldaña stated that filming was "kind of only halfway done" and that the crew is "about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand."[102] Saldaña finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both Avatar 2 and its sequel, while Cameron stated around the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.[22][23] On November 14, 2018, Cameron announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.[40]

Live-action
In February 2019, Landau stated that live-action filming for Avatar 2 and 3 would commence in New Zealand in the spring of 2019.[103] Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had "only wrapped for [the motion capture parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two movies."[104] Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New Zealand.[105][106][107]

On March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the Avatar sequel films in New Zealand had been postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in Los Angeles.[108] However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects continued at Weta Digital in Wellington.[109] In early May, health and safety production protocols had been endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country.[110] On June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would resume filming. This would make Avatar 2 and 3 the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after postponing filming due to the pandemic.[111][112][113][114] On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production.[115][116] In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after over three years; he estimated Avatar 3 to be "95%" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed outside of New Zealand.[117][118][119]

In July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the Avatar sequels had received over NZ$140 million worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant. By comparison, The Hobbit trilogy had received NZ$161 million in film subsidies. While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[120]

Visual effects
"It's never been done before and it's very tricky because our motion capture system, like most motion capture systems, is what they call optical base, meaning that it uses markers that are photographed with hundreds of cameras. The problem with water is not the underwater part, but the interface between the air and the water, which forms a moving mirror. That moving mirror reflects all the dots and markers, and ... it creates thousands of false targets, so we've had to figure out how to get around that problem, which we did. ... It's taken us about a year and a half now to work out how we're going to do it."

— Cameron, on blending underwater filming and motion capture system.[121][122]
On July 31, 2017, it was announced that Weta Digital had commenced work on the Avatar sequels.[123] The film will heavily feature underwater scenes, actually filmed underwater with the cast in performance capture.[89][90] Blending underwater filming and performance capture being a feature never accomplished before, it took the team a year and a half to develop a new motion capture system.[122][121]

Landau stated in November 2015 that Avatar 2 would have a number of major technological improvements since the first movie. A lot more of the lighting work on the virtual production stage could be done during production instead of post-production, and like Alita: Battle Angel, which is produced and co-written by Cameron, the crew can use two lightweight HD head cams to record the actors' facial performance. In addition they also used two digital puppets instead of just one; one that is an accurate copy of the real actor, and another that is the actor's character, allowing the team to re-target one onto the other to make it as accurate as possible.[124][125]

Cameron stated that there was possibility that the film could be shown in "glasses-free 3D", along with the sequels.[126][127] But he later disagreed with these rumors and did not think the technology would be there yet.[128]

The film was completed on November 23, 2022.[129]

Music
Avatar composer James Horner was originally reported to score music for the franchise, before his death in a plane crash in June 2015.[130] In December 2019, Simon Franglen, who had previously worked with both Cameron and Horner as record producer and arranger since 1997's Titanic, including on Avatar (notably completing Horner's score for 2016's The Magnificent Seven after his passing), was reported to write music for the film.[131] Landau confirmed his involvement in the project in August 2021, while also associating with the forthcoming Avatar sequels.[132][133] Horner's score will be reused in the film, in addition to the original themes produced by Franglen.[133] The scoring for the film officially began on July 29, 2022, at the Newman Scoring Stage in 20th Century.[134] The soundtrack album will be released by Hollywood Records. In November, it was reported that the film would feature an original song titled "Song Chord" which will be performed by Franglen and Zoe Saldana.[135]

Marketing
Avatar: The Way of Water
The film's title was revealed at the 2022 CinemaCon.
Steven Gould has been hired to write four novels based on the four Avatar sequels, starting with Avatar 2.[136] After several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the Avatar sequels, including Avatar: The Way of Water for Avatar 2, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were "among titles that are in consideration, but no final decisions have been made yet."[137]

At the 2022 CinemaCon,[138] the new title for the sequel was officially announced and the first teaser trailer was debuted at the event,[139] along with four new first look images, showing off the adventures of the Na'vi on and off the coasts of Pandora.[3] It was theatrically showcased at the premiere of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,[140][141] and was later released online on May 9, 2022.[142] The teaser finished its first 24-hour online window with 148.6 million views,[143] including 23 million from China alone, according to 20th Century Studios.[144][145] Grant Ridner of GQ commented "The trailer features minimal dialogue and primarily focuses on shots of the cerulean Pandora and its residents, as well as indigenous flora and fauna."[146] However, Stuart Heritage of The Guardian criticised the teaser saying that "There isn’t a trace of premise here, or character, or any real action to speak of. Instead, we’re given a minute and a half of nice-looking scenery. It’s like being held hostage to look at someone’s holiday photos."[147] Louis Chilton of The Independent also felt that the trailer "feels rather too much like a tech demo, or the trailer for a long-gestating video-game sequel".[148]

In June 2022, the teaser was edited ahead of the theatrical screenings of Pixar's Lightyear, where sequences featuring Sully hold a rifle and few guns were edited. According to Russ Burlingame of Comic Book Resources, the trailer was edited due to "public sentiments to avoid glorifying gun violence" as Lightyear released after the Robb Elementary School shooting incident,[149] while TheWrap's Drew Taylor opined that the change was made on the request of Motion Picture Association for showcasing the trailer with PG-rated films.[150] New set photos were released by Empire on June 30, 2022, showing Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis in their Na'vi forms,[151] and subsequent photos were released on the following day, showing Sigourney Weaver as Jake and Neytiri's adopted teenage Na’vi daughter Kiri.[15] Though the film was not promoted at the San Diego Comic-Con event, Lego released four new sets from the franchise as a part of the promotions.[152]

8-minutes of the film's footage was showcased in 3D at the D23 Expo on September 10, 2022.[153][154] McFarlane Toys had launched several action figures based on the characters and creatures, which were unveiled at the event.[155] The collections were officially released on October 1.[156] A second footage from the film is shown during the credits of the Avatar re-release on September 23, which evidently varies in different versions and screenings.[157][158] The official trailer was released on November 2, 2022, at Good Morning America. A concept art book titled The Art of Avatar: The Way of Water, written by Tara Bennett and illustrated by Robert Rodriguez, was made available for pre-order in October 2022, and will be released simultaneously with the film.[159] Another book titled, Avatar The Way of Water: The Visual Dictionary by Joshua Izzo is also set to be released with the film.[159] New brand poster characters were released on November 21, 2022, and the second and final trailer was also released.[160][161]

Release
Avatar: The Way of Water is scheduled to be released on December 16, 2022, distributed by 20th Century Studios and the film will also be released in RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, IMAX, and IMAX 3D formats.[162] The Way of Water alongside the forthcoming sequels will be released in Dolby Vision.[81] The film was subjected to eight delays, as the crew took more time on the writing, pre-production and visual effects process. Initially, the film was scheduled for release in December 2014.[6] By mid-2013, Cameron originally intended Avatar 2 to be released in December 2015,[58] which was subsequently delayed to 2016 and then to 2017.[60][59] In April 2016, Cameron announced four Avatar sequels which would be released in December 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023;[63] but, in March 2017, he stated that this film would not be released in 2018, due to extensive production and the visual effects process.[163]

In April 2017, a new release date of December 18, 2020 was announced, with all the other sequels: Avatar 3, 4 and 5 releasing on December 17, 2021, December 20, 2024, and December 19, 2025, respectively.[10] However, following the announcement of the three upcoming Star Wars films,[164] in May 2019, the sequels were delayed another two years, with this film being scheduled to be released on December 17, 2021.[165] The release date was again deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in August 2020, a new release date of December 16, 2022 was announced.[162] Mentioning about the delays, Cameron felt optimistic that it would not harm the films' success, comparing it to his films Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens, which were both commercially successful sequels released seven years after the original films.[81][166] The film was also approved for release in China, making it one of the few Hollywood blockbusters to be granted permission in 2022.[167]

Runtime
In July 2022, Empire revealed the runtime was "around three hours" at that stage in production.[168] In October 2022, the film's runtime was revealed to be 190 minutes (3 hours and 10 minutes).[1] In the Empire interview, Cameron stated "I don't want anybody whining about length when they sit and binge-watch [television] for eight hours... I've watched my kids sit and do five one-hour episodes in a row. Here's the big social paradigm shift that has to happen: it's okay to get up and go pee."[169][170]
